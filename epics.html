    <h2 align="left">What Is an Epic?
</h2>
    <p align="left">
      An epic poem is a lengthy, narrative work of poetry. These long poems typically detail extraordinary feats and adventures of characters from a distant past. The word “epic” comes from the ancient Greek term “epos,” which means “story, word, poem.”
    </p>
    <br>
    <h2 align="left">How Did Epics Originate?</h2>
    <p align="left">Epic poems trace back to some of the earliest human civilizations—both European and Asian. Take the Epic of Gilgamesh, considered by some scholars to be the oldest surviving example of great literature. The poem is thought to have been written in approximately 2100 BC and traces back to ancient Mesopotamia. It tells of the ancient king Gilgamesh, a descendant from the Gods, who embarks on a journey to discover the secret of immortality. </p>

    <br>
    <h2 align="left">What Are the Characteristics of an Epic Poem</h2>
    <p align="left">The meter of epics varies depending on cultural custom. Ancient Greek epics and Latin epics were typically composed in dactylic hexameter. Old Germanic epics (including those in Old English) typically contained non-rhyming alliterative verse. Later English language epics were written in Spenserian stanzas and blank verse. An archetypal epic poem typically:</p>

   <li align="left"> Is written in a formal style</li>
   <li align="left"> Contains third-person narration and an omniscient narrator</li>
   <li align="left">Frequently invokes a Muse who provides inspiration and guidance to the poet</li>
  <li align="left"> Takes place in an era beyond the range of any living memory</li>
   <li align="left"> Typically includes a journey across a variety of settings and terrains</li>
  <li align="left">Features a hero with immense bravery and resolve</li>
   <li align="left"> Includes obstacles and circumstances that are otherworldly and even supernatural—pitting the hero against nearly insurmountable odds
  <li align="left"> Looks with concern to the future of a civilization or culture</li>

The poems are quite short: it would take about as long to read the whole Inferno as it would to read the detailed canto summaries and analyses, although they might be helpful for understanding Dante's difficult language. In the Inferno, Dante starts on ground level and works his way downward; he goes all the way through the earth and Hell and ends up at the base of the mountain of Purgatory on the other side. On the top of Purgatory there is the terrestial paradise (the garden of Eden), and after that he works his way through the celestial spheres.
